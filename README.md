## **Introduction**

Match-Maker is a card memory game, where the aim of the game is to match pairs of cards in a grid. For each pair found, the player gains a point. The amount of moves made are recorded and each game is timed, adding an extra challenge element to the game.

The main requirement of this project is to build a responsive, front end gaming site, with the primary objective of making Match-Maker easy to play.

## **UX Development**

### **1. Strategy Plane**

UX research was carried out through discussion with:

- Friends and family, specifically my 5 year old daughter.
- Work colleagues

### **User Stories**

#### **First Time User Goals**

1. As a first-time user, I want to be able to access the game quickly and easily and be able to navigate the rest of the site with ease.
2. As a first-time user, I want access to instructions on how to play Match-Maker.
3. As a first-time user, I want to be able to locate the game creator's social media links for information on any other developments.
4. As a first-time user, I want to be engaged in the game and it's function.

#### **Returning User Goals**

1. As a returning user, I want to be able to access the game quickly and easily.
2. As a returning user, I want to be engaged in the game and it's function.
3. As a returning user, I want access instructions if I need a refresher on how to play the game.
4. As a returning user, I want to be able to locate the game creator's social media links for information on any other developments or updates.

#### **Frequent User Goal**

1. As a frequent user, I want to be engaged in the game and it's function.
2. As a frequent user, I want to access game instructions easily.
3. As a frequent user, I want to be able to contact the owner of the site if required.

### **Research**

A lot of research was carried out online, where I played different games in order to identify something which could be educational and entertaining and understand the capability of a javascript platform. Also being actively aware of my daughter's reaction to these games, for example she became particulary interested in the Math game built during the CI module phase.  I also considered offline research through general play with my daughter; she enjoys games that a easy to understand and quick to win, such as Snap and Memory.

- Sector Research

I researched sites that focused on memory games, which helped to guide me on the best approaches, themes and layout for my game.

Examples of sites I reviewed to bolster my research:

[Memozor, free memory games](https://www.memozor.com/memory-games)

[Help my kid learn](https://www.helpmykidlearn.ie/activities/5-7/detail/memory-card-game)

### **Project Goals**

The project goal is to provide an educational and entertaining gaming website 'Match-Maker'. The target audience will primarily be for ages 5+, and will be pitched at the capabilty of that age group.

### **User Goals**

The target audience for this website is age 5+. The key thing for this gaming site is that it should be entertaining and educational.

Specifically targeted towards:

- Anybody interested in memory games
- Those looking for an entertaining and educational gaming experience
- People who are looking to improve their memory
- The game's theme targets younger users, giving the chance to learn more about different shapes

### **Other Considerations**

Match-Maker has further considerations as below:

- Calming and family friendly presence
- Minimal, to the point content
- Simple to operate

[Back to top](# Match-Maker)

### **Strategy Table**

Based on the research, goals, and the considerations above, I considered what should be implemented on the website. I mapped the ideas based on their importance (driven by business goals and user needs), and viability (given limited time and resources), to determine which ideas were going to be included and which were not:

| Features/Ideas           | Importance | Viability |
| ------------------------ | :--------: | --------: |
| A. Coach bio             |     5      |         5 |
| B. Code of Ethics        |     5      |         5 |
| C. Contact Details       |     5      |         5 |
| D. Testimonials          |     4      |         5 |
| E. FAQs                  |     4      |         5 |
| F. Coaching overview     |     4      |         5 |
| G. Links                 |     4      |         4 |
| H. Social Media profiles |     3      |         4 |
| I. Guarantees            |     2      |         1 |
| J. Mental Health Referal |     2      |         2 |
| K. Feedback Form         |     2      |         3 |

### 2. **Scope Plane**

Based on the mapping in Strategy Plane, I decided to include these contents below in the website:

- Coach Bio and background; introduces the user to the coach.
- How Coaching works; will inform the user of what Life Coaching is, and whether it is the right choice for them.
- Contact form; which will include a request for a coaching session or further information depending on what the user needs.
- Frequently Asked Questions; which will further aid the user's decision based on the choice to try out Life Coaching.
- Location and approach; a map will be included, as well as suggestions based on where coaching could take place.
- Functionality requirements:
  the user should be able to navigate easily through the website to access all the contents via a navigation menu.
- The user should have access to the owner's contact details as required
- The user will be able to access a series of testimonials via a user friendly carousel

### 3. **Structure Plane**

The website must have a simple structure with a user friendly navigation element to reach each page of information. Each site page will be broken down into sections, and organised so that the information tells a story, and leads the user to a contact page if they want to explore the subject further. The pages will have a consistent predictable template to help with usability and accessibility.

### 4. **Skeleton Plane**

The initial layout and interface of the Website has been created using Balsamiq Wireframes. The design/layout and feel of the site was created with UI in mind, which allows immediate interaction in first-time learning, and meets the needs of the intended audience.

![Balsamiq-wireframes](/assets/images/balsamiq-ms2.png)

### 5. **Surface Plane**

#### **Color Scheme**

The color pallette for this site was sourced from [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). To create a cohesive color scheme.

#### **Typography**

The fonts I used for the website were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Inc [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) and [Lexend Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend?query=lexend). Lexend used for titles and Roboto for paragraphs/general text. Both fonts are recommended for use for people with dysleia [(Tink 'n' Stink)](https://www.tinknstink.co.uk/blogs/news/why-we-use-the-dyslexia-friendly-font-lexend). After researching [commonly used fallback fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_fallbacks.asp), I decided to use serif, sans serif and monospace as Think-In -Space's fallbacks.

#### **Imagery**

I have utilised a mix of free to use images sourced online, and the Coach's personal pictures of local green space/blue space etc. I have used a fallback color if the main body image doesn't load.

## **Features**

### **Current Features**

#### 1. **Header**

- The header consists of a website logo which sits on the left hand side of the page, navigation bar and title. The nav-bar includes three nav-links on the right hand side that link to each site page. The header occupies 100% width of the site.

- The navigation bar is fully responsive on all device sizes. On desktop view, the user can see all nav-links, while on a smaller device, these collapse to a [Bootstrap Hamburger](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/#toggler) menu.

- The main logo is not displayed on a small device to create more space for content and features. This is done using a CSS Media Query.

- The Nav-links have a subtle hover state when the user hovers over each link, and includes a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/list-group/#active-items) .active class to show which page the user is on.

#### 2. **About me page**

- The About me page includes three sections which give a brief introduction of the Coach;

- The Coach, Background and Tried and Tested sections include information about the Coach's life experience and qualifications, as well as how the Coach has already helped others.

#### 3. **Coaching Page**

- The Coaching Page includes three sections which inform the user about Life Coaching;

- The Why Life Coaching, What to Expect, and Testimonials sections include information and reviews based on what would normally be involved if a user decides to book a coaching session, and help them decide whether this coaching/journey is right for them.

- A Bootstrap Carousel has been added to display testimonials/reviews and is fully responsive on all devices.

#### 4. **Contact Page**

- The Contact Page is divided into three sections, which allows the user to contact the Coach or book a session;

- The Get in Touch and FAQs sections contain a contact form, map and answers to frequently asked questions to assist the user.

- All sections are 75% width of the screen size and fully responsive on different sized devices.

#### 5. **Footer**

The Footer uses the same color as the Navigational Menu and provides social media links that all open in new tabs. The Footer also contains the site logo which takes the user back to the About Me Page.

#### 6. **Learn more Page**

A Learn More link was added to the Footer, which gives the user access to a list of educational links to external sites. This give the user the opportunity to find out more about Life Coaching and associated subjects.

### **Features to be added in the future**

These features will be added where possible during further development phases:

- A time/date picker to book available coaching sessions automatically. This is likely to be created/added to the site once Elwyn can establish set operating times for his business in the future.
- A Legitimate form url address where the user's details can be stored and utilised by the Coach.

- An option to have the website translated to Welsh if the user prefers.

- More FAQs and Reviews as the business progresses.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Main Languages used**

[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) was used to create the front end framework of the website.

[CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) was used to design the layout and aesthetics of the website, including using effective typography and complimentary colors that would improve UX.

### **Additional Languages Used**

[Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) was used to implement functions that allowed the Hamburger menu in Navbar, and a carousel to display several testimonials. Both were applied for a better UX.

### **Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used**

1. [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website, as well as adding components.

2. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the “Roboto” and “Lexend” fonts into the html file, and were used on all parts of the site.

3. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

4. [Codeanywhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) IDE was used for creating the website and using the built in terminal to push the site to GitHub.

5. [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to store the project's code after being pushed from Codeanywhere.

6. [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) were used to design the general layout and feel of the website and the high fidelity mock up during the design process.

7. [Autoprefixer CSS](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) was used to add vendor prefixes to the CSS rules, to ensure that they work across all browsers.

8. [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://8002-coder4916-ci-milestone-ylxy4w9e48.us2.codeanyapp.com/index.html) was used to preview the website across a variety of popular devices.

9. [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) was used to reduce the file size of the images, and change from .jpg to .AVIF. This helped to improve the overall performance of the website.

10. [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a cohesive color scheme for the website.

## **Issues and Bugs**

- Issue: Bootstrap navbar toggler would not collapse correctly, once expanded on a small device.

Solution - After some tutoring, it was noticed that I had an additional Javascript bundle link included in the HTML. Once deleted, the toggler was tested, and worked.

- Issue: Gaps still appearing around .row and .col classes when importing from Bootstrap whilst using the no gutters class:

Solution - Understanding Bootstrap 5, and being aware of updates. Eg. the class ".no gutters", to remove automatic padding that Bootstrap provides with .div rows and columns, became ".g-0". The solution to this was found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21254889/how-to-remove-the-gutter-spacing-between-columns-in-bootstrap)

- Issue: Bootstrap color automatically added when using it's .active class for the navigation bar.

Solution - Resorted to using an !Important color in navbar CSS to overide.

- Issue: Navigation menu was not responsive when changing to different devices.

Solution - When trying to make the NavBar responsive via CSS, it was found that this could be done via a Bootstrap .fluid class.

- Issue: Ports not working/updating several times on Codeanywhere IDE.

Solution - I regularly had to change the Port or reset to make the updates to the site work, so I could see the Website's progress.

- Issue/Bug: README.md automatically began deleting itself while updating, when laptop was plugged into a smart TV.

Solution - README.md had to be copied and pasted from Github repository. Some of the Readme had to be re-written.

## **Deployment**

The Website was developed using Codeanywhere as the IDE, commited to Git as a local repository and finally pushed/stored to GitHub.

### **Deployment to GitHub Pages**

The website was deployed to Github pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of GitHub Repository that will be deployed.
3. At the top of the Repository, locate the "Settings" button on the menu and click it.
4. Inside the Settings, on the left side of the page, there’s a list of tab menu. Locate the “Pages” tab, and click it.
5. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None", select "Master", and then click the “Save” button.
6. The page will automatically refresh.
7. Click on Actions and then 'Deploy Static Content to Pages'
8. There’s a notification message, your site is live at [https://coder4916.github.io/ci_milestone/], that provides the now published website on the pages tab in Github settings.

### **Forking the Github Repository**

By forking the GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository, by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to fork.
3. At the top right of the Repository just below your profile picture, locate the "Fork" Button.
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.

### **Making a Local Clone**

By cloning a GitHub Repository you can create a local copy on your computer of the remote repository. This allows you to make all of your edits locally rather than directly in the source files of the origin repository, by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to clone.
3. Above the list of files, click the dropdown called "Code".
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 4.
8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

![Frequent User Screenshot](/assets/images/contact-screenshot.png)

## **Manual Testing**

### **Responsiveness**

I used web developer tools extensively throughout the project to update and correct code, adjust website aesthetics, and check/improve and confirm responsiveness accross all devices, using a Bootstrap 'Mobile First' approach.

Below are some examples of sections that I have tested and checked for full responsiveness on all devices. These images show the sections at each [Breakpoint](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/breakpoints/#core-concepts).

![Header](/assets/images/header-responsive.png)

![Form](/assets/images/form-responsive.png)

![Background Section](/assets/images/background-responsive.png)

![Footer](/assets/images/footer-responsive.png)

### **Links Testing**

Once deployed, the website links were tested to ensure that:

All navigation external/internal links are working correctly.
The social media button and the learn more page links are working and opening in a new tab. All links were working and set to a relative filepath.
Hovering and Active states are working.

### **Forms Testing**

The Think-In-Space Form was also tested to make sure that
the required fields are working, and the form sends the input data correctly.

![Input Data sent to CI mock server](/assets/images/ci-confirm-form.png)

## **Autoprefixer CSS**

Autoprefixer CSS was used to add CSS vendor prefixes to the CSS rules after the developing process was done and the CSS was validated, to ensure that they work across all browsers.

## **W3C Validator Testing**

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the website to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

The images below are snapshots of each page of the website after the code has been put through the Validator.

![W3C Markup Validator](/assets/images/index.html-checked.png)

![W3C Markup Validator](/assets/images/coaching.html-checked.png)

![W3C Markup Validator](/assets/images/contact.html-checked.png)

![W3C Markup Validator](/assets/images/style.css-checked.png)

## **Lighthouse Testing**

Chrome Lighthouse testing was used to check the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. After applying some changes to make the performance faster, including resizing all of the images, compressing image/changing the file size and adding a rel=noopener to all external links, the results below were achieved:

- Desktop:

![Think-In-Space Lighthouse testing](/assets/images/lighthouse-testing.png)

- Mobile:

![Think-In-Space Lighthouse testing](/assets/images/lighthouse-testing-mobile.png)

## **Further Testing**

The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. Microsoft Edge required extensions to run the site images correctly.

The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as:

Windows Laptop
Mobile: Samsung Galaxy S12
Web developer tools devices

Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
